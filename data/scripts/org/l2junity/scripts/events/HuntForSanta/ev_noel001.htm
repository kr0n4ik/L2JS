Hey, you! Have you seen an old fatso wearing a red hat turned inside out with a white beard that billows about like a cloud?<br>
He left in the middle of our busiest season! How dare he leave all this work behind and run away like that? It's completely unacceptable!<br>
Look here, noble warrior, I mean warrior,  sir, er... ma'am, er...? Look here! You seem to have a lot of time, so how about a little help? Don't worry. I can pay!<br>
My cute Stocking Fairy, Tree Fairy, and Snowman Fairy are experts at finding the old man. Just bring one of them around, and it will be a cinch! <br>
