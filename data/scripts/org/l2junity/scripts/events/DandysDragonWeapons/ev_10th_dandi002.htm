<font color="LEVEL">Equip </font> the <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Dragon Weapons Borrowed by Dandy</font> and use the <font color="LEVEL">Dandy's Breath</font> skill.<br>
You need <font color="LEVEL">Dandy's Scroll: Release Seal</font> in your <font color="LEVEL">Inventory</font> to use the skill! Also, you can only use Dragon Weapons for an <font color="LEVEL">hour</font>, so don't you go wasting them on stupid stuff!<br>
Oh, and one more thing. I actually have some <font color="LEVEL">Genuine Dragon Weapons</font>! Haha! Just let me know if you're one of the lucky few who gets a Dragon Scroll: Boost Weapon by talking to me every day, and I'll get you a genuine dragon weapon!<br>
You lucky chaps, you.<br><Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="RETURN" action="bypass -h Quest DandysDragonWeapons ev_10th_dandi001.htm">Back</Button>
