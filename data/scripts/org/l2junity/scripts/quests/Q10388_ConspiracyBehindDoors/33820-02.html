Oh, you were sent by Captain Kargos! Sorry about that.<br>
Your next task is further along, on the way to the chapel. Talk to <font color="LEVEL">Priestess of Light Razen</font>. I'd take you there, but I must stay at this post to make sure no one else gets hurt.<br>
Hey, wait! I almost forgot, you might get attacked by Gatekeeper Zombies. Take this Visitor's Badge and you'll be safe.
