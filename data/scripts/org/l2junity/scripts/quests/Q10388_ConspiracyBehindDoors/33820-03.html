You need to go further inward for the next mission. Ahead of you, on the way to the chapel, is <font color="LEVEL">Priestess of Light Razen</font>. I would take you there, but I must stay at my post here to make sure no one else gets hurt.<br>
Be careful when you move onward! You might get attacked by Gatekeeper Zombies. Here, take the Visitor's Badge and you'll be safe.
