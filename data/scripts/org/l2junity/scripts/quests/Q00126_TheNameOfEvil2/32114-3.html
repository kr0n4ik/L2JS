Anyway, I feel a lot less burden knowing that you'll take care of this matter. I imagine, however, that you may be feeling rather pressured. How could you not be, when you have basically just been entrusted with the fate of the entire Elrokian tribe on this island?<br>
But you're the chosen warrior, are you not? If you ever come to possess Gazkh, it will not be a coincidence.<br>
And this isn't much, but please take it as a token of my appreciation. You have a big task ahead of you, meaning there are many preparations to make. I hope you'll find it useful. Now then, I wish you all the best.
