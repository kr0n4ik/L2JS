There...<br>
I am simply binding you to the oath on Shilen's behalf... She and she alone can give you Gazkh.<br>
You undoubtedly know of the great tragedy that Shilen suffered after the seal of Sailren. The poor goddess was abandoned by her parents, her brothers, and her sisters. She was shunned by all and transformed into the goddess of death. The world today has forgotten how wise and powerful Shilen was. Were she still the water goddess, she would have prevented much of the chaos that is now rampant in the world.<br>
