I cannot give you Gazkh myself, but bring before me the pieces of Gazkh and I shall put them together into a complete Gazkh for you.<br>
In other words, if you can gather all pieces of Gazkh that were shattered and scattered during the last battle against Sailren, I can recreate it for you.<br>However, as you need to find out where all the pieces are, look for someone who could help you with clues to where the pieces may be found. I suggest you inquire with the person who initially charged you with this mission.<br>
