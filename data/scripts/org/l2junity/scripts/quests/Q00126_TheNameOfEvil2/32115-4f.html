After much deliberation, the two gods appointed Shilen as the Mistress of Water. And Eva, they assigned her the task of bard and poet. She was sent to travel between the other four gods, singing, playing music, composing poems, and generally lifting their spirits and souls.<br>

So, it wasn't surprising that they trusted her to control and care for the powerful and primeval creatures. Without her skills, the primeval creatures of this island would have plunged the world into chaos... or completely annihilated it!<br>
