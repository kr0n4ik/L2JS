<html><body>Warrior's Tomb:<br>
I definitely recognize it now. It has changed so much in shape that I almost failed to recognize it.<br>
I used to wander around here, unable to forget it even after death.<br>
It and I both have been ruined beyond recognition, but we are united at last. I'm so elated that I'd shed tears of joy if I could.<br>
Stranger, you have my deepest gratitude. But how could someone who wasn't even an Elrokian warrior know this was my Gazkh?<br>
