<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
I have mixed the ancient Elrokian warrior's spirit with yours. Now you are one, and as such you can wield Gazkh! As long as the Elrokian spirit is within you, Gazkh will serve you.<br>
Remember, your loyalty is now to Shilen and Shilen alone!<br>
In her stead, I command you, faithful warrior, to return to the Elrokian village and find the help you require to restore Gazkh.
