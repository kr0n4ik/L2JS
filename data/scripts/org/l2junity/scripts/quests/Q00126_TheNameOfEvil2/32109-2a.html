Yes, you can. It will be dangerous, but if you face Sailren while wielding Gazkh, you will weaken the creature's power. Then we, the stone guardians, can rally our power and seal him again in his prison. But to wield Gazkh, you must take the Warrior's Oath, which can be made only by an Elrokian who has undergone the rite of passage. The spirit at the warrior's grave gave you his ashes so that you might present them to me and satisfy the conditions of the oath. In doing so, you will become one with the Elrokian warrior. Are you ready to take the Warrior's Oath?<br>
