<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
(You tell him about your experience at the warrior's grave.) Very interesting. I have sensed Sailren's energy growing. I can feel the ancient evil, pushing, testing, waiting for a chance to pounce.<br>
The seal stones that hold him are old and do not have the power they once possessed. There is a chance that we would be unable to restrain him if he tried to break free. I have prayed to Shilen for guidance.<br>
With your arrival, I know that our gracious mother has answered our prayers. Now, it may be possible to defeat him.<br>
