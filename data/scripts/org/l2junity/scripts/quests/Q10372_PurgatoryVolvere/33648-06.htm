Excellent. As you mentioned, the strongest of the creatures is the <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Succubi</font>. 
They are also known as Succubus Disciples, but that is beside the point.<br>
I need you to kill these creatures and extract from them their Essence. 
I need you to collect <font color="LEVEL">10 Succubus Essences</font>from their corpses before they turn to ash and bring them back to me. 
As soon as you return I can finish my report.
