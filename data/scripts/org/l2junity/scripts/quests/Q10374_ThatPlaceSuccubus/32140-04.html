<body>Vice Hierarch Zenya:<br>
Thank you. I think the crisis is over, thanks to you. Don't let your guard down, though, Shilen's creations keep trying to get outside the tomb. Anyway, now that we have a minute, let me introduce myself. My name is Zenya. I was a Vice Hierarch in the Kamael Village.<br>
As you know, Shilen mercilessly destroyed the Kamael Village. I, along with a few of my friends, barely survived. Without a home, we wandered, many places before we found out that Shilen had ordered her creations to search for power to resurrect herself.<br>
The Shilen's resurrection must be stopped at all costs. If that evil witch is resurrected, this world will be filled with death. Adventurer, this is the calling for all of us, regardless of our race. I beg of you, stay, and help me.
