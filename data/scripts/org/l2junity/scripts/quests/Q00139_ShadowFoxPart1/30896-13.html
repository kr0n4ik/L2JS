<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Mia:<br>
My client desires the secret trading book from the Lizardmen, which records dealings with Iason.<br>
...<br>Please listen carefully now....<br>
If you go to the <font color = "LEVEL">Field of Silence</font> and hunt for <font color="LEVEL">Tasaba Lizardmen and Tasaba Lizardman Magicians</font>, you will obtain <font color="LEVEL">Document Chests and pieces of their keys</font> from them. If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">10 pieces of the chest keys</font>, I can combine them into one whole chest key.<br>
We could then use the key to open a Document Chest, and as we open more boxes we may be able to find what we're looking for.<br>
Please bring me the pieces of the Document Chests and chest keys to me, adventurer....
