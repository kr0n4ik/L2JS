<html><body>Devil's Isle Survivor:<br>
I know, I know, I look terrible! It's these blasted nightmares. Every night! And every morning when I wake up I'm emotionally and physically drained. No more energy than a slice of toast. But the weirdest thing is that I'm not the only one having these nightmares. Creepy, isn't it?<br>I thought it might be this Kamaloka I've heard so much about, but they're saying it's something different.<br>
The mages think it has something to do with a place called Pailaka.<br>
Whatever its name, someone's got to go there and do something or we're all going to go slowly mad from these nightmares! Please say you'll help! What do you say? Will you do it?<br>
