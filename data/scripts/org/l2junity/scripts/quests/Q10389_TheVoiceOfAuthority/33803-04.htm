It must be a result of Shilen's rise in power. <font color="LEVEL">Triol</font>, the master of these pagans, is a devil henchman for the goddess. With Shilen's rise, he became stronger, and his Voice of Authority now rules the lands around the Pagan Temple. Strange, seeing power from the world of the dead spreading so visibly across the lands.<br>
