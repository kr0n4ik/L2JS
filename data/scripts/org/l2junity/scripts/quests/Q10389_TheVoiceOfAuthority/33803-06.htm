Prove your strength to me if you wish to enter the chapel. Fortunately, the pagans here are weaker than those in the chapel - defeat 30 out of <font color="LEVEL">Old Aristocrat's Soldiers, Resurrected Workers, Forgotten Victims, Ritual Offerings, Ritual Sacrifices, Resurrected Temple Knights, Triol's Believers, Triol's Laypeople, and Triol's High Priests</font>, and I'll consider you worthy.
