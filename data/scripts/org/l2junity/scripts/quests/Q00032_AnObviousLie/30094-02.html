That would be very gracious of you. I will repay you the best I can.<br>
You see, <font color="LEVEL">Miki the Cat </font>is really bad at directions. I got a map to help with that, but you see... it's left behind right here.<br>
Last I heard from Miki was at the <font color="LEVEL">entrance to Devil's Isle</font>. Miki was trying to stop by to get some other herbs there, but contact was cut afterwards. Lost and wandering, probably. If you come across Miki, could you hand over this map and bring me the herbs?</body></html>
