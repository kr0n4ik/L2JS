It's true, I tell you. Call the guards. I don't care. I can't make Adena magically appear.<br>
Tell you what, though. How about I make you an ornament worth even more than that? You just bring me the materials. I'll need <font color="LEVEL">70 Low-grade Armor Fragments and 145 Low-grade Accessory Gems</font>. I can use what I have at the shop for the rest. Trust me, this ornament is rare and of great value.
