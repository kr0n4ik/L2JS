<html><body>Guillotine Fortress Watchman Roderik:<br>
After <font color="LEVEL">Guillotine of Death</font> turned this place into his fortress, everything changed, even the land. We can't spare scouts, but it's impossible to plan without knowing more about the area. Could you scout for us?<br>I've heard that the <font color="LEVEL">Tombstones</font> are particularly haunted, so check the <font color="LEVEL">Tombstone of Houpon the Warden Overseer, Tombstone of Crook the Mad, and Tombstone of the Guillotine of Death</font>. Large numbers of brutal Undead monsters have been seen there.<br>When you've finished scouting, report to <font color="LEVEL">Guillotine Fortress Watchman Endrigo</font> over there, and give him this report as well.
