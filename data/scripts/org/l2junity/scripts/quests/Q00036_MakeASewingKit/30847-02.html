What brings you here? Ah, Leikar sent you? The Sewing Kit she ordered, eh? I was just about to get started on it. I'll just be a moment...<br>

Hmm... I must've used it all up! Sorry, you'll have to come back later. I'm out of materials. (Only a character with Lv. 85 or above may undertake this quest.)
