Curious one, aren't ya? Well, don't bite off more than you can chew.<br>
I can't tell you too much for sure until we make more progress in our research. But at this time, we do need something for sure.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Stabilized Ectoplasm</font> -- ever heard of it?<br>
Apparently you can get it from <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elf Magister Errickin in Hunter's Village</font>, but you can see that I'm too swamped in research to travel.<br>
Will you go and get it for me? The <font color="LEVEL">Stabilized Ectoplasm</font>?
