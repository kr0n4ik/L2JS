Your assistance has helped the Aden Vanguard deliver a fatal blow to Shilen by dealing with her Champion of Death. 
Now the soldiers of Aden can return home and protect it.<br>
Although this has been victory, news from Aden Vanguard has me concerned. 
As much as I would like to attend to these matters personally, I have work here that must be complete. Do you think you can help me?<br>
