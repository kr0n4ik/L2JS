Hmm... the rock can wait. 
There was an attack on Aden? That is very good news! I mean, that helps prove my theory. 
If you track all of Shilen's attacks or areas where she has increased the number of her creatures you can see a correlation... looks like a search grid... <font color="LEVEL">she is looking for something</font>.<br>
Quickly, you have to hunt down <font color="LEVEL">Scavenger Scarabs, Scavenger Ants, and Shrine Knights</font> and bring me back <font color="LEVEL">30 samples of their Remnant Ashes</font> to be safe. 
They are already in the area so we must be quick before Shilen sends in her creations. 
Once I have these samples, it will help me determine if there is a threat to Goddard here or not.
