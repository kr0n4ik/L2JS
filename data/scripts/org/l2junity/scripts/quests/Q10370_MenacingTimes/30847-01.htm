It was a good thing you were here. 
Aden Castle would be in rubble now if it weren't for you and the Aden Vanguard defeating Shilen's Champion of Death. 
Aden should be safe now and should calm down and go back to normal.<br>
But I don't quite trust the Aden Vanguard. 
I understand how exhausted you must be, but can you do me a favor one more time?<br>
