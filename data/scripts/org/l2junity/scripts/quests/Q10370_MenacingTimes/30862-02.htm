As you already know Shilen sent several of her creatures to destroy Aden Castle. 
With your help, you and the Aden Vanguard were able to stop this attack. 
Now our soldiers can come home and focus on protecting Aden.<br>

well if what they are saying is true it could be a real crisis in Goddard. 
Do you wish to hear about it?<br>
