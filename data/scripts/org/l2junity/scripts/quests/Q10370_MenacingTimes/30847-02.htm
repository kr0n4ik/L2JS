As you already know Shilen sent several of her creatures to destroy Aden Castle. 
With your help, you and the Aden Vanguard were able to stop this attack. 
Now our soldiers can come home and focus on protecting Aden.<br>
Although I heard a rumor from the Aden Vanguard that is a wee bit troubling. It ain't right and poor timing to ask ya after a triumphant battle, but the folks in Goddard are in need of your help. 
Do you think you can help them out?<br>
