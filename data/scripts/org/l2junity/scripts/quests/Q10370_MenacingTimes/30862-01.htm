Thank you for assisting the Aden Vanguard in defeating Shilen's Champion of Death. 
Aden should be safe now and should have the resources to defend this town once again.<br>
Have you heard the news from the Aden Vanguard yet? No? Hmm... 
well if what they are saying is true it could be a real crisis in Goddard. 
Do you wish to hear about it?<br>
