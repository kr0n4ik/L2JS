<html><body>Grand Master Brome:<br>
As you already know Shilen sent several of her creatures to destroy Aden Castle. 
With your help, you and the Aden Vanguard were able to stop this attack. 
Now our soldiers can come home and focus on protecting Aden.<br>
I wish this was the end of this crisis, but the Aden Vanguard has just sent me some troubling news. 
It appears that your services are in need again. 
Care to test your strength?<br>
