<html><body>Captain Andrei:<br>Hmm... this comes from the Aden Vanguard? 
Yes, I had my <font color="LEVEL">suspicions</font> that Goddard may be in danger. 
There has been a lot of strange activities in the Goddard territory. 
However, since Shilen has invaded our world that is somewhat of an understatement. 
There is something strange anywhere you look now.<br>
I hope you are up for more of a challenge than just delivering this message to us. 
Several of Goddard's forces are out on missions and we are short on manpower here. 
We're looking for anyone who can swing a sword or cast a spell.<br>
