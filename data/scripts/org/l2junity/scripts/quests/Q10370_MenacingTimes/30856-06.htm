The Aden Vanguard reports they have spotted several <font color="LEVEL">Shilen's creatures</font> entering the Aden Territory from <font color="LEVEL">Goddard</font>.<br>
If this is true, we must find out why these creatures appeared in Goddard and how they came to cross to our lands! 
We can't find a solution until we pinpoint the origin of the problem.<br>
So, will you go notify Goddard of this? <br>
