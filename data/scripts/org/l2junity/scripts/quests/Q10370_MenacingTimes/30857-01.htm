Thank you for helping the Aden Vanguard in defeating Shilen's Champion of Death. 
Aden is now safe and we have the resources to defend this town once again.<br>
But there is some troubling news from the Aden Vanguard. 
I know you have done more than enough for the town of Aden, but would you care to possibly lend us your strength once more?<br>
