<html><body>Academy Guide Acateo:<br>
To lend a helping hand to those who have joined the academy, we are handling out Academy Circlets. These will prove to be very helpful until you graduate from the academy.<br>
Also, users who have reached a certain level will be eligible to exchange their Academy Circlets with <font color="LEVEL">Enhanced Academy Circlets</font>. Put your trust in the academy, and concentrate on growing! Ho ho ho!!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">(Only users who have reached Lv. 80-85 prior to graduating from the Academy are eligible to receive Enhanced Academy Circlets)</font><br>
