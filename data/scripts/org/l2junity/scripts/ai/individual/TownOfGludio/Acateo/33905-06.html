I'm sorry, but only players who bring Academy Circlets can receive the enhanced Academy Circlet.<br>
Please check your inventory to see if you currently have an Academy Circlet.<br>
If you have an <font color="LEVEL">Augmented Academy Circlet</font>, these can be <font color="LEVEL">exchanged after canceling augmentation</font>. <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Academy Circlets</font> <font color="LEVEL">cannot be exchanged</font>.
