<html><body>Academy Guide Acateo:<br>
Greetings, my name is Acateo. I have come to Aden to guide you through the academy.<br>
I have come to Aden with good news, that the academy system now provides even greater benefits.<br>
First, characters having joined the academy will receive an <font color="LEVEL">additional 10% XP until they graduate</font>. Second, if you use the <font color="LEVEL">mentoring</font> system together, the <font color="LEVEL">number of Mentee's Marks</font> given to the mentee will increase. Lastly, if <font color="LEVEL">a member of the academy at level 40 or higher levels up</font>, <font color="LEVEL">additional Clan Fame points</font> can be gained.<br>
What astounding benefits are these?<br>
Spread the word and direct anyone who wishes to join to me. Each person who joins the Academy receives a welcoming gift of Academy Circlets.<br>
