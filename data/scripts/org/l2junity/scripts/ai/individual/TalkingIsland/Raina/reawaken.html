In order to reawaken your dual class, <font color="LEVEL"><br1>
 you need the cloak you received when you first awakened it,<br1>
and %price% Adena</font> to pay the fee.<br>
Upon reawakening, you will lose your current abilities, but gain new powers in exchange. You will be reduced to <font color="LEVEL">level 85, and all your skills will be reset</font>.<br1>
You can choose the class you want, but <font color="LEVEL">you cannot receive powers from the same class as your main class</font>.<br1>
