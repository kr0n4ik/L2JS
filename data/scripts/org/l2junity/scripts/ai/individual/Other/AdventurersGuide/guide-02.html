The Steel Door Guild has announced that it will be cutting off supplies of Steel Door Guild Coins. There is no cause for concern. It's just that you won't be getting any more. If you bring Steel Door Guild COins, you will be eligible to continue to receive support from the Steel Door Guild.<br>
How may I help you?
