<html><body>Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br>
The Lords of Dawn and the Dusk use <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Adena</font> as their currency, following in the old empire's tradition.<br>
Tradition and customs are important but they are so old... If you were to go to the market with that money in this day and age, you couldn't buy a thing.<br>
Do you have any Ancient Adena that you don't know what to do with? If you do, I'll exchange them for Adena.<br>
Also, if your weapon has a unwanted special ability, I can remove that, too. I don't know why you would want to remove, but we black marketeers will do anything for Adena.<br><br>
