You ask what La Vie En Rose's Elegant Brooch is? It's a top-level brooch that activates 6 jewel slots. It's a new item!<br>
I've been hearing news about this high-class jewel for a while. I heard it has an unimaginable amount of power, but of course, you need that many jewels. You can't just make an Elegant Brooch.<br>
You need to add an extra jewel to a La Vie En Rose's Radiant Brooch and make it shine, so you need a special ingredient. You need <font color="LEVEL">Jewel Powder</font>. If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">440 Jewel Powder</font> and <font color="LEVEL">1 La Vie En Rose's Radiant Brooch</font>, I'll make an Elegant Brooch for you!<br>
Things have gotten much easier now so you can use a <font color="LEVEL">Jewel Grinder</font> to refine jewels. I heard you can get it from an Ultimate Jewelry Box. If you have a hard time collecting Jewel Powder, just bring me a Jewel Grinder.<br>
If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">1 Jewel Grinder</font> and <font color="LEVEL">1 Jewelry Box</font>, or a <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 1 Jewel</font>, I'll exchange them for <font color="LEVEL">Jewel Powder</font>. It doesn't matter what kind of jewel it is.<br>
