I'd like you to know that this Ancient Tome of the Demon is not the same as the <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Demonic Tome</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Bloodied Demonic Tome</font> found in Hellbound. Unless I touch the newly found ones with my own hands, I cannot really appraise them.<br>
Anyway, the Ancient Tome of the Demon is an old tome regarded as an unholy scripture by the Demons of Hellbound. It was created through the power of darkness and contains a mysterious energy, which can be very useful -- if you can obtain it, of course.<br>
You can find the Hidden First Page, the Hidden Second Page and the Demon Contract Fragment by reading this book. However, it will turn to dust if you try to use physical strength on it, so you must be careful.<br>
If you bring it to me, I can put it to good use -- it will be utterly useless to you, in case you had other ideas. But give it to me and I will exchange it for an item of greater value for you.<br>
