<html><body>Hunters Guild President Arcturus:<br>
Hello there. So you're interested in the Hunter Guild?<br>
I'm the new Guild Master, Arcturus. I'm originally a hunter. This is such a nuisance.<br>
Well, I really had no choice. They implored that I take the position and help to revive the Hunter Guild, and I couldn't refuse.<br>
All that I want to do is restore the Hunter Guild to its old glory, then get back to a life where I can hunt as much as I want.<br>
