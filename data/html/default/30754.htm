<html><body>Watcher of Antharas Gilmore:<br>
I am Gilmore, watcher of the beast Antharas...<br>
I must monitor every breath that demon dragon takes, every twitch of its mighty tail, to assure that it does not awaken from its deep sleep. I have watched the beast for 1,000 years, since I led an army against him. We were able to subdue the beast, but he must be watched.<br>
Do you truly desire to face Antharas, the Earth Dragon? He is imprisoned in a cave with no entryway. There is only one way in or out...  The <font color="LEVEL">Heart of Warding</font>...<br>
