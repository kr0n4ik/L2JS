<html><body>Watcher of Antharas Gilmore:<br>
... The Heart of Warding is a doorway that was made by those who imprisoned Antharas... A <font color="LEVEL">Portal Stone</font> activates it. <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchman Theodric</font> distributes Portal Stones to those who have been approved by the seal watchmen.<br>
If you wish to obtain a Portal Stone, you should go and see Gabrielle. Gain her approval and then come back to see me...<br>
