A mentor can have up to 3 mentees at the same time. Every time a mentee levels up, the mentor receives the <font color="LEVEL">Mentee's Mark</font> in the mail.<br>
Between Lv. 1 and 50, the mentor receives mail every 10 levels. After Lv. 50, the mentor receives mail each time a mentee levels up. Be sure to delete unnecessary mail, as you cannot receive new mail if your mailbox is full. <br>When a mentor and mentee are both online, the mentor can receive a powerful ability-raising buff and the mentee can receive XP and an SP bonus buff.<br>
When a mentee who has a mentor finishes awakening or the 3rd liberation, he automatically graduates and receives a Mentee Certificate in the mail.<br>If the mentor and mentee end their contract prematurely, the mentor must wait 2 days to find another mentee. If the mentee graduates, the mentor must wait 1 day to find another mentee.<br>
